### ❄ Research Overview ❄️
Currently, I am working on using Landsat, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope imagery to classify snow-covered area on glaciers using a supervised classification algorithm. I hope to use this method to detect changes in snow line elevations on glaciers over time, which is an important indicator in glacier mass balance applications (in other words, it helps us estimate how much mass the glacier is gaining each year). Here is an example of a classified PlanetScope image at Wolverine Glacier on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, with an approximate snowline elevation marked by the black line:

### ⭐️ Personal SMART for the semester ⭐️
1. Be able to efficiently load, create, and manipulate spatiotemporal datasets using the `xarray` package, including data visualization tools. 
2. Learn about and use 5 new climate datasets available for Idaho. 
3. Learn about best practices and effective strategies for programming _sprints_ with other team members. 

| SMART | Goals |
|---|---|
| S | Specific |
